## 🔮 Future Updates

While the application is fully functional and meets the core objectives, there are several areas I plan to improve in upcoming iterations:

### 📉 Model Accuracy
The current implementation utilizes a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for sign language recognition. While it provides a working baseline, I am not fully satisfied with its accuracy and responsiveness.

In future updates, I plan to replace this with a **custom-trained model** built using **TensorFlow** and **MediaPipe**, tailored specifically for ASL gestures. This should lead to significantly improved precision and overall user experience.

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
The current user interface is minimal and functional, but it could benefit from additional polish and interactive elements. Planned improvements include:
- Enhanced visual design for better accessibility
- Animated transitions and feedback
- Improved layout and responsive design for mobile devices

### 🚧 General Vision
This current build represents a **foundational version** of the larger vision I have for ASL Learning Buddy. While it demonstrates core functionality, future versions will be more robust, intelligent, and user-friendly.

Stay tuned for exciting updates in the near future!
